## Introduction

I am looking to extend the range of my portfolio by creating a productivity application called "Eat the Frog". This app will help users tackle their most challenging tasks, known as "frogs", through a gamified experience.


### Core Features

I have identified the following features that should be implemented in the first release of the application:

- The user should be able to add a task to the app
- A task should have at least a title and description
- The user should be able to mark a task as complete
- The user should be able to delete a task
- The user should be able to edit a task's details
- Duplicate task titles should not be allowed
- The user should be able to view all tasks in the app
- The user should interact with the application through a console interface


### Additional Features

In addition to these core features, the I would like to see these in the application if time permits:

- The user should be able to prioritise tasks
- The user should be able to set deadlines for tasks
- The user should be able to search for a task by title and have the results displayed
- The user should be able to view tasks by their priority or deadline
- The user should be able to delete all tasks at once, confirming that they want to do this before proceeding

## Tasks

1. Add documentation why the user needs this software and the benefits that it will bring to them:
   - The problem that the software will solve
   - The benefits that the software will bring to the user
   - The impact that the software will have on the user's business
2. From the requirements listed above, create user stories that break the functionality required down.
3. From the user stories, create domain models and/or class diagrams for the core features of the application:
   - The classes that I will need to create
   - The data types of each attribute
   - The access modifiers of each attribute and method
   - The return types of each method
   - The relationships between the classes
4. Using a test-driven approach, implement the core features of the application.
5. Create an application that will put some tasks in the application, run in the GUI, and take the user's input to navigate a menu to use the features.

## Eat the Frog Brief

Gamifying a productivity app called "Eat the Frog" can make tackling challenging tasks more engaging and motivating. Here are some ideas to incorporate gamification elements into my app, with the addition of Pomodoro combos:

### 1. **Point System and Rewards**
- **Points for Completion**: Award users points for completing their most difficult tasks, the "frogs." More challenging tasks yield higher points.
- **Daily Streaks**: Encourage consistency by awarding streak points for consecutive days of task completion.
- **Achievements and Badges**: Unlock achievements and badges for milestones like completing 5 frogs in a week or maintaining a streak for 30 days.

### 2. **Pomodoro Combos**
- **Morning and Afternoon Sessions**: Encourage users to complete a Pomodoro session in the morning and another in the afternoon. Completing both sessions in a day can yield bonus points.
- **Combo Bonuses**: Offer extra rewards or unlock special features when users consistently complete both Pomodoro sessions daily over a week.

### 3. **Levelling Up**
- **Experience Points (XP)**: Users earn XP for each task completed, helping them level up. Higher levels can unlock new features, themes, or additional customisation options.
- **Skill Trees**: Implement skill trees where users can unlock productivity boosts or new abilities (e.g., the ability to defer a frog without penalty) as they level up.

### 4. **Challenges and Competitions**
- **Daily/Weekly Challenges**: Set specific challenges for users, such as "Complete 3 pomodoro's before noon" or "Finish a frog task every day for a week."
- **Leaderboards**: Add leaderboards for friendly competition. Users can compare their scores with friends or a broader community.

### 5. **Virtual Rewards and Customisation**
- **Virtual Currency**: Users earn virtual currency for completing tasks, which they can spend on in-app items such as new themes, avatars, or productivity tools.
- **Customisation**: Allow users to customise their avatars or app interface as they earn more points or currency. Option to rename Eat the Frog to others (ie. daily burning task), so that people considered not morning people can warm up with smaller tasks first.

### 6. **Interactive Elements**
- **Mini-Games**: Include mini-games that are unlocked by completing tasks. These can serve as short breaks and provide additional motivation.
- **Progress Bar**: Show progress bars for individual tasks and overall goals to visualize achievements and motivate completion.

### 7. **Narrative and Storytelling**
- **Story Mode**: Integrate a story where completing tasks advances the narrative. For example, each frog eaten helps the userâ€™s avatar on a journey to save a kingdom or achieve a personal dream.
- **Characters and Companions**: Introduce characters or companions that provide tips, encouragement, and rewards for task completion.

### 8. **Social Features**
- **Accountability Partners**: Allow users to pair up with friends or community members to encourage and challenge each other.
- **Share Achievements**: Enable users to share their progress and achievements on social media or within the app community.

### 9. **Feedback and Analytics**
- **Performance Insights**: Provide detailed analytics on productivity trends, streaks, and areas for improvement.
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Use encouraging messages and feedback to reinforce good habits and task completion.

### 10. **Pomodoro Integration**
- **Pomodoro Timers**: Integrate Pomodoro timers to help users break tasks into manageable intervals. Completing a "frog" task within a Pomodoro session adds an extra layer of achievement.
- **Combo Challenges**: Create challenges where users must complete a certain number of Pomodoro sessions focused on frog tasks. Successfully completing these challenges can offer substantial rewards.

### 11. **Privacy and Security**
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensure all user data is encrypted to protect privacy.
- **Back-Up Cloud Storage**: Offer cloud storage options for data backup.
- **Local Storage**: Provide the ability to store data locally if preferred.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enhance security with 2FA.
- **Opt-Out Preferences**: Allow users to opt-out of features like analytics, tracking, and social sign-ins.
- **Social Feature Controls**: Enable users to turn off social features like direct messages and party invites.

By incorporating these gamification elements and the Pomodoro technique, "Eat the Frog" can transform routine productivity into an engaging, motivating experience, helping users tackle their toughest tasks with more enthusiasm and persistence.
